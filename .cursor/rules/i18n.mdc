# OneSky i18n Bootstrapping & Sync Rules

These rules ensure your project is fully wired for localization from day one and stays in sync as you develop.

---

## 1. Ensure an i18n Framework Is Installed  
Check for a known framework. If none is found, install and configure a popular i18n library.

---

## 2. Load or Create OneSky Configuration File  
If `.oneskyapp.yml` exists, read its `source_path` and `translation_path`. Otherwise, fetch the template from  
`https://developers.onesky.ai/docs/github-integration-configuration`  
and write it based on your project’s string-file structure.

---

## 3. Determine Source Language  
Infer the default locale from the `source_path` folder or file name. If inference fails, default to `en`.

---

## 4. Extract All UI Text (Initial Scan)  
Scan your code for hard-coded UI text. For each literal string:  
1. Generate a unique key.  
2. Replace the inline text with your framework’s translation function.  
3. Append the key and original text to the source string file.

---

## 5. Capture New Text Additions  
On each file save, detect any newly added UI text. Append each new string to the source string file.

---

## 6. Sync Text Updates to Translations  
When a source string is modified, update the corresponding entries in all translation string files to keep them in sync.
